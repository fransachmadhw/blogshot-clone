## üìå About This Project
Blogshot is a modern blog web-based app which is integrated with GraphCMS, a headless CMS. My lecturer asked us to create a management system app as a final project, instead, I decided to create something more modern and less technical, I chose a blog app. Blogshot can be considered a personal blog publishing which is you can write your blog and publish it to Blogshot via GraphCMS.
